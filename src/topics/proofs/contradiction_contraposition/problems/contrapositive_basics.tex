\question 
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item Write the contrapositive of this statement: if a quadrilateral is not a rectangle, then it does not have two 
pairs of parallel sides.
\begin{solution}[2in]
If a quadrilateral has two pairs of parallel sides, then it is a rectangle.
\end{solution}
\item Write this statement and its contrapositive in mathematical notation: for all natural numbers $a$ where $a^2$ is even, $a$ is even.
\begin{solution}[2in] 
The original statement would be 
$a \in \N$, $a^2$ even $\implies a$ is even. 

Its contrapositive is 
\tboxed{$a \in \N$ and $a$ odd $\implies$  $a^2$ odd} 
\end{solution}
\item Write this statement and its negation in mathematical notation: For all integers $x$, there exists an integer $y$ such that $x^2 + y = 16$.
\begin{solution}
The statement in mathematical notation would be 
$$\forall x \exists y, x^2+6 = 16, x,y\in\Z$$
and its negation is
$$\exists x  \forall y, x^2 + y \neq 16, x,y, \in \Z$$
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
